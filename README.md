# Word Frequency-Perl
 
A small script was created with the intent of experimenting with Perl.

## In this script I used:
- [x] Perl I/O.
- [x] Regular expressions(regex)
- [x] Data structures: Hash table, Scalarsand, Arrays.
- [x] Perl functions to manipulate data like "sort".
- [x] Perl subroutines

## If you would like to run the script:
Make sure that you have Perl installed on your machine.
You can get Perl from here https://www.perl.org/get.html.

After you can run the following command in the terminal:

```perl wordsFreq.pl```
